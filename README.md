### Hi, I'am Laura Orozco ðŸ‘‹

I am a statistician and I am currently doing a masters in analytics, I have been working for the last 3 years in data science and machine learning projects, my biggest interests are part of my continuous training in machine learning so, this year I did part of the Data Science 4 All program and I am doing a career track in datacamp about Machine Learning Scientist. I really like to share the experiences of my colleagues working in data science so I am participating as an ambassador of Woman in Data Science 2021. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Anomaly Detection project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about MLOps and POO.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in data science communities in Cali.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with NLP topics.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am madly in love with my cat ðŸ˜»
